# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## App Overview

**AmpedMap** is a crowdsourced energy drink tracking app. Users report what energy drinks are in stock at stores near them; others see that data on a live map. The core loop: find a store → submit a stock report → map updates in near-real-time.

Live at: `https://ampedmap.com`

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # Start dev server (Next.js + Turbopack)
npm run build    # Production build
npm run start    # Start production server
npm run lint     # ESLint via Next.js
```

No test runner is configured.

## Tech Stack

## Architecture

### Routing & Middleware

All routing uses Next.js App Router. `src/middleware.ts` optionally gates the entire app behind a waitlist when `MIDDLEWARE_WAITLIST_ACTIVE=true`.

Key pages:
- `/` — Main map experience (the core feature)
- `/stores` — Filterable store list
- `/leaderboard` — Rankings via Supabase RPC
- `/submit` — Stock report submission
- `/add-store` — Store submission form
- `/account` — Profile, badge, stats, subscription management
- `/admin` — Admin dashboard (tier-gated)

### Auth & User State

`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` is the source of truth for auth state. It provides `user` (Supabase auth user) and `profile` (app-specific profile row) to the entire app. Profile fetching uses up to 4 retry attempts with exponential backoff.

All pages use `'use client'` — there are no React Server Components rendering auth-dependent UI. Auth sessions are managed entirely client-side via the Supabase JS SDK.

### Database Schema

Core tables in `public` schema:
- `profiles` — Extends `auth.users`; holds `username`, `tier`, `stripe_customer_id`, badges, stats, location
- `stores` — Store records with `lat`, `lng`, `status` (pending/approved/rejected)
- `stock_reports` — Individual drink-at-store reports submitted by users
- `latest_stock` — Materialized view of the most recent report per drink per store
- `drinks` — Drink catalog (name, brand, flavor, caffeine)
- `stock_confirmations` — Community votes on stock accuracy (`confirmed` boolean, unique per store+drink+user)
- `notifications` — User notifications (real-time via Supabase Realtime)
- `waitlist` — Pre-launch waitlist emails

**Supabase row cap**: The server-side `max_rows` is 1,000. Any query fetching all stores must paginate using `.range(from, from + BATCH - 1)` in a loop — never rely on `.limit()` alone.

Admin and webhook operations use the service role client (bypasses RLS). Regular client uses the anon key (subject to RLS policies).

### Tier System

| Tier | Features |
|---|---|
| `free` | 5-mile map radius, view stock, limited submissions |
| `tracker` | Unlimited radius, advanced analytics, badge system |
| `admin` | All tracker features + moderation |

Tier upgrades go through Stripe. The webhook at `/api/stripe/webhook` handles fulfillment by updating `profiles.tier` and `profiles.stripe_customer_id`.

### Maps

`src/components/MapView.tsx` renders a Mapbox GL map. Supercluster aggregates store markers client-side (radius: 60px, max zoom: 16). The user's live location shows as a pulsing dot. Store markers use emoji icons. Radius is enforced via Haversine distance filtering in `src/hooks/useNearbyStores.ts`.

`useNearbyStores` caches the store list in memory with a 60-second TTL. It paginates in 1,000-row batches to work around Supabase's server-side `max_rows` cap.

### API Routes

All routes live in `src/app/api/`. Each route:
1. Validates the request with `checkRateLimit()` from `src/lib/rateLimit.ts`
2. Uses the Supabase service role client for privileged operations
3. Returns JSON responses

Rate limiting is **in-memory per instance** (not distributed/Redis) — it resets on server restart and does not coordinate across Vercel function instances.

Key routes:
- `POST /api/stripe/checkout` — Creates Stripe checkout session
- `POST /api/stripe/webhook` — Handles Stripe events (subscription lifecycle)
- `POST /api/stripe/cancel` — Cancels subscription
- `POST /api/email/welcome` — Sends welcome email via Resend
- `POST /api/geocode` — Geocodes an address string to lat/lng
- `POST /api/stock/confirm` — Upserts or deletes a community confirmation vote on a stock report
- `POST /api/admin/delete-user` — Admin user deletion
- `POST /api/invite` — Converts a waitlist entry to a full account

### Theming

Theme (light/dark) is stored in `localStorage` and applied via `data-theme="light"` on `<html>`. CSS custom properties (`--bg`, `--surface`, `--accent`, `--text`, etc.) drive all colors. A flash-prevention script in the root layout reads localStorage before first paint. The theme context lives in `src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx`.

### Stock Report Accuracy

Stock reports on store pages show a freshness state based on age:
- **Fresh** — reported < 2h ago
- **Aging** — 2–12h ago
- **Stale** — 12–24h ago
- **Unverified** — > 24h ago (greyed out)

All users see the freshness label; `tracker` tier users additionally see the exact time ago.

Each drink card shows ✓/✗ community confirmation buttons. Votes are stored in `stock_confirmations` and displayed as counts. Optimistic UI updates on tap; tapping the same button again removes the vote.

### Geofencing

Stock report submission (`/submit/drinks`) enforces a 500m radius around the target store. Distance is calculated client-side via Haversine using the user's GPS and the store's `lat`/`lng`. If location is unavailable, submission is still allowed. The submit CTA shows a live distance chip and is disabled when the user is too far.

### Location (iOS Safari)

`src/hooks/useLocation.ts` checks the Permissions API before auto-requesting geolocation. If permission is already `granted`, it requests immediately on mount. Otherwise it waits for a user tap (required for iOS Safari). The initial map screen shows an "Enable Location" button to trigger the first request via user gesture.

### PWA

Manifest generated at `src/app/manifest.ts`. Service worker registered via `src/components/ServiceWorkerRegister.tsx`. Offline fallback page at `/offline`.
